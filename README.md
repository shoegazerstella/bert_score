### Overview
BERTScore leverages the pre-trained contextual embeddings from BERT and matches
words in candidate and reference sentences by cosine similarity.
It has been shown to correlate with human judgment on setence-level and
system-level evaluation.
Moreover, BERTScore computes precision, recall, and F1 measure, which can be
useful for evaluating different language generation tasks.

For an illustration, BERTScore precision can be computed as

### Installation
Install from pip by 

```sh
pip install bert-score
```

Install it from the source by:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Tiiiger/bert_score
cd bert_score
pip install -r requiremnts.txt
pip install .
```

### Usage

#### Metric
We provide a command line interface(CLI) of BERTScore as well as a python module. 
For the CLI, you can use it as follows:
1. To evaluate English text files:

We provide example inputs under `./example`.

```sh
bert-score -r example/refs.txt -c example/hyps.txt --bert bert-base-uncased 
```
2. To evaluate Chinese text files:

Please format your input files similar to the ones in `./example`.

```sh
bert-score -r [references] -c [candidates] --bert bert-base-chinese
```
3. To evaluate text files in other languages:

Please format your input files similar to the ones in `./example`.

```sh
bert-score -r [references] -c [candidates]
```
See more options by `bert-score -h`.

For the python module, we provide a [demo](https://github.com/Tiiiger/bert_score/blob/master/example/Demo.ipynb). 
Please refer to [`bert_score/score.py`](https://github.com/Tiiiger/bert_score/blob/master/bert_score/score.py) for more details.

Running BERTScore can be computationally intensive (because it uses BERT :p).
Therefore, a GPU is usually necessary. If you don't have access to a GPU, you
can try our [demo on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kpL8Y_AnUUiCxFjhxSrxCsc6-sDMNb_Q)

#### Practical Tips

* BERTScore relies on inverse document frequency (idf) on the reference
  sentences to weigh word importance. However, when the set of reference
  sentences become too small, the idf score would become inaccurate/invalid.
  Please consider turning off idf scaling, by setting `no_idf=True` when calling
  `bert_score.score` function.
* When you are low on GPU memory, consider setting `batch_size` when calling
  `bert_score.score` function.
